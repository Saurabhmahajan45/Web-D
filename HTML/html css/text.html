    <p>A <b>mango</b> is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It originated from the
        region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. <sup>[1][2]</sup> M. indica has been
        cultivated in South
        and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and
        the "Southeast Asian type". <sup>[1][2]</sup> Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits
        that are also
        called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[3]</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The English word mango (plural mangoes or mangos) originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word manga,
        from the Malay mangga, and ultimately from the Tamil mā (மா, 'mango tree') + kāy (ங்காய், 'unripe
        fruit/vegetable')[8][9][10] or the Malayalam māṅṅa (മാവ്, 'mango tree') + kāya (കായ, 'unripe fruit').[11] The
        scientific name, Mangifera indica, refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India.[10]</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are
        long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.[12]</p>
    <p>In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and
        anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil.[4] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres
        (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly
        changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature.[4] The flowers are produced in terminal panicles
        10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in)
        long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.[4] Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known,[4] many of which ripen in
        summer, while some give a double crop.[13] The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening.[4]
